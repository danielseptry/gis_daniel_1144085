BACKGROUND
We already know that the development of these technologies will be more advanced. So many ways that we use to bring new inventions that exist in this world, where the question is perkembanagan technology for the future. The discovery in question is one of which is a GIS. Given these findings it is very helpful in menyelesaika problem.
So it can be said that in the absence of progress, the system is useless. Therefore mutually support each other. Humans can communicate using jaringn
Given these developments, we will better understand the use of the system, because with this application can help in interaction so that communications made to run smoothly.

DISCUSSION
At this meeting I will explain kai of geospatial data. Where geospatial data has two parts, namely the data vector and raster data. Vector data that is a collection of dots that make up the dotted line, so that the dotted line that will form a region. While the raster data is an area that can diliat by sensing the small size, so it can also use the tool.
Discussion of the most important is create, edit, delete the geospatial data. But we membahasas matteri kaliini that leads to shp. In this shp terdpat many maps that can be downloaded for free suppose province, country, etc.. This is the shape most commonly used. In shapefile especially in maps is a world map with boundaries - a border etc. that have different scale levels - different.

In the file data is stored in the form of coordinates that can be accessed directly with the form of records. As mentioned before about the division of vector that points, lines, and areas that support the shapefile format.

CONCLUSION
From the discussion above, we can draw conclusions with their gis the communications made by man can walk with their GIS, GIS buffer is also used for business so that we jalanka business will go well. Let us take the example that one company, then pads discussion this time we can use the way - the way shapefile to determine areas with far. Therefore, at this task we can determine the record on an area, here there are 255 records that have us practice.

SUGGESTION
For suggestions kedepanya will hopefully be better, find references mendunkung with the discussion taken. Study well so that more master Those materials so that the discussion would be better anyway.
